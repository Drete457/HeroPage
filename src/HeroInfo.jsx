    <p>
      Natsu is a lean, muscular young man of average height with a slightly tan skin tone, 
      black eyes, spiky pink-colored hair, and has abnormal sharp canines;
      Natsu has a scar on the right side of his neck, hidden by his scarf.
      Following his intense battle with the Rogue Cheney of the future, 
      Natsu gains a cross-shaped scar on the left side of his abdomen, 
      a result of the two fatal wounds the man dealt to him during their altercations.
      He later attains a new scar, this one being a jagged blemish on his right cheek, 
      which he gained following his battle with Zeref.
      Natsu's guild mark is red and is located just below his right shoulder.
