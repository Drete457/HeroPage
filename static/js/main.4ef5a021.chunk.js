Following his intense battle with the Rogue Cheney of the future, Natsu gains a cross-shaped scar on the left side of his abdomen, a result of the two fatal wounds the man dealt to him during their altercations. He later attains a new scar, this one being a jagged blemish on his right cheek, which he gained following his battle with Zeref.

He has also been known to wear a rolled up comforter strapped across his back, though he rarely carries it in battle. In the year X791, Natsu's attire receives minor changes. He now wears an open-collared, one-sleeved long overcoat version of his original waistcoat, which is instead tucked in and zipped. The sleeve covers Natsu's left arm with a faux leather brown armband, leaving his Fairy Tail mark, as well as his entire right arm, consequently exposed. Natsu continues wearing Igneel's scarf and retains the same lower clothing. He now wears his wristband on his right wrist.")}function d(){return r.a.createElement(g,{url:"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsu_Dragonil",name:"Wikipedia"})}function m(){return r.a.createElement(g,{url:"https://aminoapps.com/c/genesis-portugal/page/item/natsu-dragneel/kwmD_KRghQI7eVMEZ3ZJpE8VaEzob8KxVNzUQ",name:"Fan Page Portugal"})}function g(e){return r.a.createElement("a",{href:e.url,target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},e.name)}Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));function w(){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"MainBody"},r.a.createElement(h,null),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"HeroInfo"},r.a.createElement(c,null),r.a.createElement(u,null)),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"Links"},r.a.createElement(d,null),r.a.createElement(m,null)))}i.a.render(r.a.createElement(r.a.StrictMode,null,r.a.createElement(w,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}],[[4,1,2]]]);
